There are a lot of type names scattered around the executable, but it's hard to distinguish them between being unique to WSC, and possibly being a leftover from the earlier games. 
As such, I've only included ones that begin with "RP" and/or are generic enough to have appearred across all the Wii Sports games.

Misc type names:
	RPSysObjAsSceneLoading
	RPSysSysMsgWinMgr
	RPSysDVDStatus
	RPSysPauseMenuBgLyt
	LayoutDrawMgr (likely in WSR onwards)


(These do have source files, but they don't really serve much purpose to be included)
